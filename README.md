More information on the architecture of Marxan Web is available in the [Developer Documentation](https://andrewcottam.github.io/marxan-web/documentation/docs_dev.html).  

## Hosted Marxan Web (beta version)

## Installer for Windows
The installer for Windows is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/andrewcottam/marxan-web/releases) section of this repo.  

## Install script for the Windows platform
This contains the install script for building the Windows installer for the local installation of Marxan Web. It is a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System file (*.nsi) and instructions for using it to build the installer are given in the [readme.md](https://andrewcottam.github.io/marxan-web/installers/windows/) file.

## Marxan Registry information

This list is essentially the network of servers that want to be published and made available through the Marxan Web tool.
