# Marxan Web
This is the main repo for the Marxan Web Systematic Conservation Planning tool and provides access to the following:
- Online Documentation for the tool
- Install script for the Windows platform
- Compiled installer for Windows
- Marxan Registry information
- Issue tracker
- Client apps

These are described in the following sections below. 

This repo should be used alongside the [marxan-server](https://github.com/andrewcottam/marxan-server) and [marxan-client](https://github.com/andrewcottam/marxan-client) repos which provide the source code for the Marxan Server and Client respectively. More information on the architecture of Marxan Web is available in the [Developer Documentation](https://andrewcottam.github.io/marxan-web/documentation/docs_dev.html).  

## Online Documentation for the tool
This contains the Documentation that is linked to directly from the Marxan Web app and is a set of markdown pages that are automatically build in GitHub Pages using Jekyll. The start page is the [docs_overview.html](https://andrewcottam.github.io/marxan-web/documentation/docs_overview.html) page.  

## Install script for the Windows platform
This contains the install script for building the Windows installer for the local installation of Marxan Web. It is a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System file (*.nsi) and instructions for using it to build the installer are given in the [readme.md](https://andrewcottam.github.io/marxan-web/installers/windows/) file.

## Compiled installer for Windows
The compiled installer for Windows is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/andrewcottam/marxan-web/releases) section of this repo. Click on Release and download and run the relevant installer.  

## Marxan Registry information
The Marxan Registry information is a Javascript file that contains information on all of the Marxan Servers that are shown on application startup in the Marxan Servers list box. This list is essentially the network of servers that want to be published and made available through the Marxan Web tool.  

## Issue tracker
All bugs and feature requests for Marxan Web are managed in this repo under the [Issues](https://github.com/andrewcottam/marxan-web/issues) sections.  

## Client apps
Some example applications that use the marxan-server services are included in this folder. For more information see the readme.md.
